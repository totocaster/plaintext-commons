# Plaintext Commons

Knowledge should outlast software.

---

## What is this?

A design stance for knowledge work where plain text files are the source of truth, not apps. Your folder of Markdown or .txt files *is* the platform. Tools come and go, but your files remain.

**Draft version: [ttvl.co/plaintext-commons](https://ttvl.co/plaintext-commons/)** _(tracked [here](/MANIFESTO.md))_

## The Three Laws

1. **The folder is the platform.**
   One corpus — a folder of open files — acts as the system of record.

2. **The file is the protocol.**
   Stable, human-readable plain text (Markdown or .txt) with optional front matter.

3. **No tool owns the corpus.**
   Tools are non-exclusive and interchangeable. None enforce format or schema.

## The Plaintext Test

Before adopting any tool or workflow:

1. Can I read/edit the files with a basic text editor?
2. Can I move the folder and keep working — no exports required?
3. Can the tool propose human-auditable changes before writing?
4. Will this still make sense in ten years?

If not, it's not Commons-compatible.
